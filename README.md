# Malware-Analysis

## What's that?

This is a place where I have all my reports from Malware Analysis Course  
*All reports are written in Polish*

## Project

Project is about doing full malware analysis consisting of:

1. Creating functional malware analysis environment (FlareVM + plus some other tools)
2. Performing Advanced Static Analysis
3. Performing Advanced Dynamic Analysis
4. Creating a full report of the analysis

This project is done in pairs
